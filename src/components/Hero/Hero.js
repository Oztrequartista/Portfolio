          I am a Frontend developer with years of working experience. I've implemented designs and built products for the most used fintech application in Ghana, expressPay to achieve over 500,000 + downloads across US, UK and Ghana. Iâ€™ve gained extensive experience in designing useful and intuitive user interfaces, programming, testing, and debugging processes. I have worked on a number of projects from conceptualisation to completion. I take pride in coding to consistently high standards and regularly love to refresh my skills to ensure that I am up to speed with emerging technologies. I have a strong desire for mastery and it keeps me constantly learning.
