          I am a self-taught Frontend developer with a background in sales. Iâ€™ve
          gained extensive experience in building useful and intuitive user
          interfaces, programming, testing, and debugging processes. I have
          worked on a number of projects from conceptualization to completion.
          I'm currently the lead Frontend developer for the Government of
          Ghana's website. I take pride in coding to consistently high standards
          and regularly love to refresh my skills to ensure that I am up to
          speed with emerging technologies.
